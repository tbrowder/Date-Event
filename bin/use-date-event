    Usage: {$*PROGRAM.basename} input | example [options]

    Modes:
      input=X     - where X is the input file
      example[=X] - where X is the output type [default: JSON]

    Converts the input file to a JSON file. The input file
    must be one of two types: 
      1. rakumod with a single hash defined
      2. csv
      3. JSON

    All types must have all the fields needed for all the attributes used
    by the Date::Event or for the child class derived from it.

    The input file type is expected to be identified by its suffix (.rakumod, 
    .csv, or .json).
