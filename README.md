DESCRIPTION

**Date::Event** is a class that provides basic attributes to describe an event occurring on a particular `Date`. It is suitable for multiple instances on a `Date` and is defined as follows:

    enum EType (
        Birth       => 1, 
        Christening => 2,
        Baptism     => 3,
        BarMitzvah  => 4,
        BatMitzvah  => 5,
        Graduation  => 6,
        Wedding     => 7,
        Anniversary => 8,
        Retirement  => 9,
        Death       => 10,

        Holiday     => 100,
        Other       => 200,
    );

    class Date::Event {
        has $.id;
        has $.name;
        has $.short-name;
        has EType $.type;
        has Date $.date;
        has Date $.date-observed;
        has $.notes;

        # A default event is normally set on a certain date.
        # Many holidays are an exception in that they are calculated
        # based on on or more date criteria or conversion
        # from another calendar (e.g., from Jewish to Gregorian).
        has Bool $.is-calculated = False; 
    }

    method is-calc {
        $!is-calculated = True
    }
